# Langflow One-Click Install

## What This Script Does

When you run the script, it will prompt you to set up a virtual environment or activate one.

This script performs the following steps automatically:

### Create a Python virtual environment:

A new isolated Python environment will be created specifically for Langflow. This helps keep your global Python environment clean and prevents conflicts with other packages.

### Activate the virtual environment:

The newly created Python virtual environment is then activated, ready for the installation of Langflow.

### Install Langflow:

The script will install the latest version of Langflow within the activated virtual environment. This ensures that you'll always start with the latest features and improvements.

### Launch Langflow:

The script doesn't stop at just installing Langflow. It goes the extra mile and launches the Langflow server for you.

### Open Langflow in a browser:

Finally, to make things even more convenient, the script will automatically open Langflow in a new browser tab. You'll be ready to start using Langflow immediately.
